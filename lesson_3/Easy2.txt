1.  In this hash of people and their age,

      ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }

    see if "Spot" is present.

    A: ages.include?("Spot") or ages.key?("Spot") or ages.has_key?("Spot")
    or ages.member?("Spot")

2.  Starting with this string:

      munsters_description = "The Munsters are creepy in a good way."

    Convert the string in the following ways (code will be executed on original
    munsters_description above):

      "tHE mUNSTERS ARE CREEPY IN A GOOD WAY."
      "The munsters are creepy in a good way."
      "the munsters are creepy in a good way."
      "THE MUNSTERS ARE CREEPY IN A GOOD WAY."

    A:  munsters_description = munsters_description.swapcase!

        munsters_description.capitalize!

        munsters_description.downcase!

        munsters_description.upcase!

3.  We have most of the Munster family in our age hash:

      ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 5843, "Eddie" => 10 }

    add ages for Marilyn and Spot to the existing hash

      additional_ages = { "Marilyn" => 22, "Spot" => 237 }

    A: ages.merge!(additional_ages)

4.  See if the name "Dino" appears in the string below:

    advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pe
    dinosaur."

    A: advice.include?('Dino') or advice.match?('Dino')

5.  Show an easier way to write this array:

    flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]

    A: flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)

6.  How can we add the family pet "Dino" to our usual array:

    A: flintstones << 'Dino'

7.  We could have used either Array#concat or Array#push to add Dino to the
    family. How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)

    A: flintstones.push('Dino', 'Hoppy') or
      flintstones.push('Dino').push('Hoppy') or
      flintstones.concat(%w(Dino Hoppy))

8.    Shorten this sentence:

      advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet
      dinosaur."

      ...remove everything starting from "house".

      Review the String#slice! documentation, and use that method to make the
      return value "Few things in life are as important as ". But leave the
      advice variable as "house training your pet dinosaur.".

      A: advice.slice!(0, advice.index('house'))

9.    Write a one-liner to count the number of lower-case 't' characters in the
      following string:

      statement = "The Flintstones Rock!"

      A: statement.count('t')

10.   Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the
      screen. If we had a 40 character wide table of Flintstone family members,
      how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?

      title = "Flintstone Family Members"

      A: title.center(40)
